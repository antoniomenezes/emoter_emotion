When LA brought back the mask mandate I feel like I lost any good feelings I had this past month, and I feel like I'm losing hope that this pandemic will get better.  |sadness|True
Going out has made me do well mentally.|joy|True
Los Angeles County (presumably) had a surge which prompted this indoor mask mandate, and it makes me want to stay inside so as to keep myself safe. As a consequence of that, however, I am regressing mentally, and my optimism for this pandemic getting better has been destroyed.|sadness|True
I'm worried that since Los Angeles brought back their mask mandate Las Vegas will as well, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to fully enjoy this vaccation. |fear|True
I'm excited about this trip, and also the opportunity to have a break from the pandemic.|joy|True
I don't want this mask mandate to ruin my trip.|fear|True
The pandemic situation is currently much better than it was last year. Only people who live in majority unvaccinated areas need to mask up. Vaccination continues to rise. Vaccinated people can proceed as normal with their life.|joy|True
It is a small relief that my dad is fully vaccinated. |joy|True
I don't like that my sister is dismissive of COVID-19 because of her anti-vax boyfriend, as well as my mother, and also the fact that my sister convinced my elderly mother to not take the vaccine.|anger|True
I have no idea how to talk about the vaccine with my anti-vax family members and I don't know how they will react.|fear|True
I'm so mad at people who refuse to get vaccinated and who keep us in this endless loop of COVID restrictions|anger|True
Because of rising cases, I'm scared that we will have to go back into lockdown. |fear|True
I don't want to get infected before my second dose because it would mess with the vaccination cycle. It scares me enough to want to isolate. The person who lives near me could very well be having COVID-19 symptoms, which is causing me anxiety.|fear|True
I'm kind of frustrated that my job and my SO keep me from going into lockdown so that I can make to my second shot safely, although I know its extreme|anger|True
With rising cases, I'm so scared of catching COVID before I can get my second shot. |fear|True
I'm a little nervous about going to the movie since people were there unmasked, coughing and sneezing, especially with the Delta wave. <SEP> I'm a little nervous about the Delta variant and the higher rate of breakthrough cases. |fear|True
It's frustrating that I'm still dealing with COVID side effects after over a month and possibly longer. |anger|True

I'm mad that the CDC is discounting milder cases of breakthrough cases even though they still have an impact on the public. |anger|True
I'm concerned about the breakthrough cases, about how they will affect pandemic recovery and possible COVID side effects that the vaccine may not protect us from. |fear|True
I'm glad at how quickly they approved the vaccines.|joy|True
I'm frustrated at the fact that the only breakthrough cases being reported are just cases with hospitalization and death. I'm directing my anger at the CDC.|anger|True
I'm worried that the number of reported cases are being understated. The fact that someone can get infected in spite of having a vaccine scares me. |fear|True
I think that, in spite of my reservations regarding the vaccine being made too quickly, I consider that a victory.|joy|True
The way that people who refuse to get vaccinated are making this pandemic even more difficult is frustrating me. |anger|True
I want the pandemic to be over soon and I'm frustrated at the unvaccinated who continue to lengthen the pandemic.|anger|True
I'm slightly worried about the possible side effects of the COVID vaccine. |fear|True

I'm horrified by my mother's heartless behavior about my dad's death.|disgust|True
I'm anxious about traveling to visit my mom since the COVID situation is bad in Kentucky and I don't know if it's worth the risk. |fear|True

My mother's irresponsible actions led to her getting COVID-19 and giving it to my at-risk father, who died as a result.|anger|True

I'm frustrated with <PERSON> voters and others who don't get vaccinated and our just elongating this pandemic. |anger|True
I'm running out of hope that the pandemic will ever end if so many people refuse to get vaccinated. |sadness|True
I associate <PERSON> supporters with anti-vax attitudes and I blame them for prolonging the pandemic. |anger|True
I'm very disappointed that our vaccination efforts are halted all because people don't want to take it.|sadness|True
I'm so happy that I managed to convince someone to take the vaccine. |joy|True
I feel a little helpless in this situation, like even though I helped one person I didn't have enough impact to actually make a change. |sadness|True
I am slightly disappointed that there is not more I can do to help end the pandemic besides encourage vaccination, which is a hard feat (e.g. accessibility issues for vaccines, hard to convince anti-vax people).|anger|True
I'm happy because I felt that I did my part in ensuring the pandemic ends swifter/ensuring the safety of others by convincing one of my former students to get vaccinated.|joy|True
I'm afraid that if we go into another lockdown I won't be able to keep my job. |fear|True
I'm excited to be working again after spending so long unemployed. |joy|True
Unemployment has a myriad of consequences, which I do not want to have to experience yet again.|fear|True

I'm frustrated with the CDC for giving misguided advice that has possibly brought more harm to the community and giving me false hope. |anger|True
I'm upset that it feels like we'll never be rid of the pandemic and that we will have to continue to live with these restrictions. |sadness|True
My optimism for masking to end has been destroyed by the rising number of cases.|sadness|True
It makes me happy to see the rising vaccination rates, even if it's because of the Delta wave. |joy|True
I'm happy that Delta is prompting (scaring) people to get vaccinated.|joy|True
I'm so frustrated with people's lack of compliance with COVID precautions as it puts me at risk and messes with my anxiety. |anger|True

I'm scared about getting COVID from this event especially because I have health issues. |fear|True
I don't know if I want to take the risk of being infected especially with Delta. I would rather not get infected again because I've had health issues after my first infection.|fear|True
I'm scared about going into the dentists since I only have one shot and I won't be wearing a mask.|fear|True
I'm generally an unlucky person, so while cracking an entire molar is awful, I can't say that I didn't expect something like this to happen.|anger|True
Returning to my home country terrifies me because not a lot of people would be vaccinated. In addition to the fact that we're in a pandemic, going to the dentist's office (no matter which country I'm in) scares me a great deal.|fear|True
I worry that our life will never feel safe or peaceful again and that there will always be one crisis after another that we'll have to worry about. |fear|True
I feel like because of the pandemic I can longer enjoy life, and that I can longer trust anything good without expecting it to fall apart. |sadness|True
While the situation in Canada is getting better, I can't help but be anxious about the possibility that it gets worse. I also can't help but feel like something else is going to happen after the pandemic ends. I don't want my future children to experience such a catastrophe.|fear|True
I'm happy that the situation is getting better in Canada. As a result, I am enjoying some activities I wasn't able to pre-vaccination. |joy|True
The pandemic has taken away my hope for the future and I desperately want to feel the happiness I used to.|sadness|True
I feel betrayed since everyone says breakthrough cases are rare, but both my friends and I all got sick even though we worked so hard to safe. |anger|True
"It's agitating that my friends and I got breakthrough cases even though it's supposedly ""rare""."|anger|True
I've been trying to minimize my risk of infection by closely following COVID-19 protocols.|fear|True

It feels like everything has been ruined by the pandemic, and my feelings of hopelessness over the situation don't feel acknowledged. |sadness|True
It is frustrating that vaccines didn't end the pandemic. People invalidating other people's feelings towards the pandemic is awful.|anger|True
The uncertainty of the pandemic's end has freaked me out.|fear|True
It's hard for me to enjoy my life with all these COVID-19 protocols. The pandemic has ruined everybody's life.|sadness|True
I'm so so scared that we will never be free from this pandemic, that we will always have to live under restrictions.|fear|True
I'm so tired of feeling trapped, and like nothing will ever be ok, living with this pandemic is just so overwhelming. |sadness|True
I feel very anxious about restrictions getting stricter, the pandemic going on forever, and not being able to leave my house. I don't want the pandemic getting worse because working in the grocery store during that time was awful.|fear|True
I was very triggered at the sight of my coworkers masking up again because it was as if the pandemic was restarting.|sadness|True
I'm very frustrated with our family/friends who refuse to take precautions even though it puts our son at risk, and then ask to see us. |anger|True
My wife and I strictly follow COVID-19 protocols. To protect our son who can't get vaccinated, we try not to maintain contact with unvaccinated people, including friends and family. |fear|True
Our son is low-risk and it's relieving to know.|joy|True
People have been making my wife and I feel bad for not seeing unvaccinated family.|sadness|True
I'm so afraid that we'll go back into lockdown again and any progress I've made will be lost and that this time my mental health will get even worse.|fear|True
All the things from 2020 have just piled up into this overwhelming weight, and though I'm trying to get better, I still feel so hopeless.|sadness|True
I do not want to go back to a time where we are at the worst times of the pandemic because I do not want to revert to the awful place I was in mentally ever again.|fear|True
I've been feeling mentally better because I have been seeking mental help alongside the fact that the pandemic has been getting better.|joy|True
With all of the things that happened to me (death of people related to me, stress from being with my parents all the time during quarantine, a lack of communication with my friends), I've been at the lowest point in my entire life, to the point where I often thought about dying.|sadness|True
I'm so mad at my sister since she doesn't seem to care that she's putting her and her family at risk with her reckless behavior.|anger|True
Because of my sister's behavior I'm scared that she's going to give us COVID, and I'm especially worried because of our family's health conditions. |fear|True
I feel hopeless because there's nothing I can do to fix this situation since my sister won't listen to me. |sadness|True
My sister having absolutely no regard for any of our family's health coupled with the fact that I can't do anything about it is so aggravating to me.|anger|True
My sibling, who, in spite of our family's myriad of issues that all make us high-risk people, continuously goes out and about, which makes her likely to get infected. I am scared for all of us right now.|fear|True
I don't feel like I can relax and trust this new normal, it feels too off-putting. |fear|True
I'm feeling conflicted since I'm trying to get back to normal, but there are reminders everywhere that the pandemic is still going on, and it makes me feel a little lost. |sadness|True
I don't like that life in my city seems to be proceeding as if the pandemic has ended; I haven't been able to shake off my fears, so doing things as usual is really causing me some anxiety.|fear|True
I'm growing more and more concerned about breakthrough cases that are happening with the Delta wave. |fear|True
It makes me feel better to know that the people close to my are vaccinated, so I can trust that they're mostly safe. |joy|True
News about Delta's transmissibility with vaccinated people is scaring me and is making me want to know the risk I am taking by getting on a plane and going to a large gathering.|fear|True
It's relieving to know that everybody I am in close contact with is vaccinated and won't be too impacted by my infection.|joy|True
It's comforting to know that we might not have to worry as much about Delta, especially in highly vaccinated areas. |joy|True
I'm happy that Delta doesn't seem to be as bad as other variants, that Delta cases are falling, and that the peak isn't as bad as the first variants. I'm also happy to see that vaccination is working.|joy|True
I'm constantly hearing news of just how bad the pandemic is, and now I feel hopeless that things are ever going to get better, and I just feel so alone and tired from all this anxiety and I feel so close to giving up. |sadness|True
The people I am closest with are certain that we're going to have another lockdown and it's causing me to think that way as well. The stress I've been having over COVID-19 coupled with anxiety over other things is adding to my fear.|fear|True
Things are looking bleak in Los Angeles County and it is making me lose hope. I don't think I have the capacity to be optimistic with how the pandemic has been looking. I can't vent to anybody.|sadness|True
I've been really worried about a possible breakthrough infection that everyone is talking about. |fear|True
I feel so comforted by the knowledge that the actual percentage of breakthrough infections is really low, it makes me feel a lot safer. |joy|True
I'm worried about breakthrough infections.|fear|True
Objectively, it is unlikely to get breakthrough infections and this is relieving me.|joy|True
I'm concerned that I might catch COVID from the funeral, and it will mess with my vacation plans. |fear|True
I have to catch a flight but I'm attending a large gathering and if I get infected I would not be able to go, which I don't want happening.|fear|True
I'm somewhat concerned that my patient's oxygen % seems abnormal.  |fear|True
I'm worried about my patient dying and am now asking others if this situation my patient is in is common so that I can assess their chances of living.|fear|True
I'm upset that others are disregarding my anxieties when I'm just trying to be cautious. |anger|True
I'm scared about the possible side effects of the vaccine (including heart problems) and I'm worried about my health. |fear|True
My fear of vaccines, in addition to the heart problems I have seen my friends get from the vaccine and their recommendations for me to not get it have prevented me from getting my COVID-19 vaccine. This has prompted me to ask others for some information about vaccines through this Reddit post.|fear|True
I'm trying to find out more about my symptoms, but it's kind of frustrating to read all these unfamiliar terms that I don't understand.  |anger|True
I'm concerned about my fever that seems to be coming and going as well as my other symptoms. |fear|True
I'm scared that I might have brain cancer, and that it is being hidden from me, and now I'm concerned about how it is affecting my mental competence as it seems to be deteriorating. |fear|True
I'm in support of continued mask mandates because I'm afraid with Delta spreading among unvaccinated populations soon even vaccinated areas will get hit. |fear|True
Due to the multiple exposures, I concerned I might have COVID, as I am already showing a few symptoms. |fear|True
I feel like my breakthrough case has broken my trust in the vaccine, and now I just feel so hopeless about the future again, especially since we've already sacrificed so much.|sadness|True
Thank you for reading my Reddit post.|joy|True
The fact that the company would risk the health of their employees in this manner is extremely upsetting.|anger|True
I'm worried about my friend's health and job if he decides to report the incident to management. |fear|True
I'm enraged by  the sheer lack of regard for employees' health, their lack of apology, their gall to think that it wouldn't happen again, the endangerment of even more people by bringing in replacements for people who can't work by my friend <PERSON>'s management/HR.|anger|True
I feel absolutely repulsed on behalf of my friend for his management's/HR's actions, which have done egregious health violations.|disgust|True
My friend <PERSON> is afraid that the management will do absolutely nothing to address the situation or punish him/others for bringing it up. Either of those two things will endanger so many people with infections.|fear|True
I'm worried that people will stop taking the pandemic seriously now that the media has moved on from COVID. |fear|True
My anxiety feels disconnected from what is being portrayed in the media, which makes me feel disconnected from the world around me. |sadness|True
I feel as if people are sweeping the pandemic under the rug and trying to make things normal again, which is dangerous for me and everybody in general.|fear|True
The fact that people are trying to act like we still aren't in a pandemic makes me feel invalidated for still being extremely cautious about my safety.|sadness|True
It's annoying to see how people are pretending that things are going back to normal when the pandemic is still going strong.  |anger|True
I'm feeling more drained the longer the pandemic continues, and I'm losing my motivation to care, especially with the new Delta wave. |disgust|True
The fact that people are assuming that the pandemic will be over is really angering me; I genuinely do not believe it will.|anger|True
"Seeing people not care about the pandemic and have little regard for other's health or the reality of the situation has given me a strong sense of ""pandemic fatigue""."|disgust|True
I feel defeated looking at how people simply do not care about respecting mask mandates and how the vaccine has dealt with Delta. It makes me think that the vaccine isn't going to win against mutations and that careless people are going to drag on the pandemic.|sadness|True
I'm excited about the increasing number of vaccinations even if it's still somewhat slow. |joy|True
Working from home took away human connection from me and I was just getting used to what was a newly appreciated aspect of my life.|sadness|True
I feel guilty about getting upset about something so small when I've gotten through this pandemic relatively well. |disgust|True
I feel like COVID has taken away my social life, and now I don't feel like I've lost all the progress I had made. |sadness|True
It's frustrating that people get mad when I refuse to tell comforting lies. |anger|True
I don't like that people are downvoting me on Reddit when I try to give a realistic perspective.|anger|True
I'm upset that my family is being so irresponsible by not getting the vaccine and that their choices have forced me to distance myself from them. |anger|True
I'm afraid that this pandemic will do irreparable damage to my relationship with my family. |fear|True
I'm upset at losing so many family members in such a short time. <SEP> I feel guilty for being a bad daughter and not being there for my mother, but I also feel torn because I don't want to put her in danger. |sadness|True
I think that my mother and my sister are making an awful decision by not being vaccinated. |anger|True
It's too risky for me to be at the funeral because I don't want to expose my mother and her family (who are unvaccinated) or for them to expose me.|fear|True
I feel awful knowing that my mother is upset that she can't see us.|sadness|True
This situation makes me uncomfortable, and I'm worried about the possible risks of attending this party. |fear|True

I don't like the fact that I could get a false negative and spread the virus around unknowingly.|anger|True
I went out, potentially infected my family, and I feel awful about it. I feel like I caused this situation.|sadness|True
I'm worried about getting a haircut since less and less people are wearing masks these days, and I don't want to risk getting a breakthrough case or possibly giving COVID to my unvaccinated kids. |fear|True
I don't like the fact that people feel comfortable going out maskless and being around maskless people, as if the pandemic has ended.|disgust|True
I do not want to go out and potentially infect my children who are not able to get vaccinated. <sep> The fact that Delta is making high numbers is really getting to me.|fear|True
I feel safe with mask mandates.|joy|True
I'm upset that some people still refuse to get vaccinated and put the rest of society at risk, but I'm also frustrated that we haven't learned to work around vaccine hesitancy.  |anger|True
I'm concerned that our society is returning to pre-pandemic normalcy and growing complacent about COVID. I just don't feel prepared to go back to normal. <SEP> I'm also concerned about the strain the pandemic has put on our mental health.  |fear|True
My friends feel betrayed because they got sick despite getting the vaccine, but I don't agree with their reactions. |sadness|True
I'm seeing some attitudes that show frustration with the fact that the vaccine isn't going to fully prevent symptoms, especially Delta. In addition, I recognize that many people are upset with unvaccinated people because they are the ones who continue the pandemic.|anger|True
I don't want people getting too used to the fact that protocols are light or even reverted because even with that, the pandemic still hasn't ended. In addition, I am very concerned with the fact that this pandemic is going to be hard on everyone mentally.|fear|True
Though my husband is experiencing symptoms, I'm at least relieved by the fact that the symptoms could be a lot worse.|joy|True
I'm happy that more people are deciding to get vaccinated.|joy|True
I am not considered legally vaccinated in the UK because <ORG> is not accepted there, thus, I cannot visit my family in the UK despite having taken the only option I had available to me in Denmark. |disgust|True
I'm so frustrated with the UK government for making it so hard to get back into the country while their other COVID policies are so lax. |anger|True
I'm scared that my <ORG> vaccine will be invalidated and that these new vaccine/booster shot policies will keep me from seeing my dad (or my grandparents) again before he dies.|fear|True
This situation makes me feel helpless, like nothing's going right, and now the pandemic has taken not only my normal life but also the chance to see my family again. |sadness|True
I'm concerned that my COVID symptoms will get worse or that I will give COVID to my parents.|fear|True
It makes me feel better to know that most of my friends are testing negative. |joy|True
I'm concerned that if we try to go with natural immunity the virus will mutate into a worse variant and just infect everyone again, creating a never ending cycle. |fear|True
I don't want for us to go to the natural immunity route; it will lead to the mutation of worse and worse variants.|fear|True
It makes me happy to know that some good things are coming out of this pandemic. |joy|True
I want to spread a bit of joy through this Reddit post by asking people how COVID-19 gave them a positive change.|joy|True
I feel like I should be doing better than this but on the other hand I'm not surprised that I'm struggling. |disgust|True
I feel like it's pointless to try and do anything at this point as no matter what we do things will still get worse, and I'm upset at myself for still trying. |sadness|True
I feel defeated looking at pandemic-related data and it only exacerbates my already bad mental health.|sadness|True
I'm having this abnormal symptom, and I'm worried that I might have allodynia and maybe a more serious condition. |fear|True

I'm unsure about the risk of hiring this new employee, since his daughter has not been vaccinated. |fear|True
I'm worried over my son's health since he is suffering such severe COVID symptoms. |fear|True
I feel torn between trying to be a good mother to my kids, but also being responsible during the pandemic, and I feel like I'm letting down my family. |sadness|True
I want to take my children (one of them being my son who is unvaccinated, caught COVID-19, and has extreme symptoms) out to do things, but choosing between what's best for his health and what's best for his happiness is tearing me apart and makes me feel like a bad mother.|sadness|True
I'm very concerned about my husband traveling since me and my (unvaccinated) kids are at risk  and Delta has been spreading rapidly, I'm afraid he might bring COVID home. |fear|True
I'm skeptical of my husband going to this funeral service because he could get infected there and if he infects me, it'd be dangerous for me as I'm immunocompromised. I'm afraid of Delta and the possibility of breakthrough infections. I'm also afraid for my kids because they aren't vaccinated.|fear|True
I'm worried about my husband's health since he has caught COVID and his symptoms seem to be getting worse. |fear|True
I feel like I'm not doing enough for my husband and I just wish there was something more I could do for him. |sadness|True
I feel awful for my partner because they lost their sense of smell to COVID-19. I wished I could be near my husband but I cannot because he's sick.|sadness|True
I'm so frustrated with doctors recommending us to get a 2nd vaccine along with the <ORG>, when they don't give us enough information on how to do it, and I'm starting to doubt how trustworthy this advice is. |anger|True
I'm displeased to see all these credible people I see telling us to get a booster without telling us the steps we are supposed to take.|anger|True
Despite knowing I'm at a low risk, I still feel incredibly anxious about the pandemic and I'm scared of getting sick with COVID.  |fear|True
I feel torn between my anxiety on COVID, but also taking the chance to have a more normal life, and I don't know if I can trust my own judgement.  |sadness|True
My fear about getting infected leads me to follow protocols very closely. The third wave happening in my country is continuing my fear of getting infected.|fear|True
I feel sad about my fear getting in the way of seeing people, and I don't like it when I'm ridiculed for it.|sadness|True
Because the last time I got the vaccine I also got infected with COVID now I'm scared to go and get my second dose (of at least this vaccine brand). <SEP> I'm nervous about waiting for a different vaccine brand since I'm also scared of the catching the Delta variant. |fear|True
I am in a situation that forces me to seek information about vaccines but I do not want my situation conflated with anti-vaxxers. Although we both question the vaccine, my intentions are different from theirs.|anger|True
I'm repulsed by the fact that the one place that was supposed to prevent me from getting infected went ahead and got me infected anyway.|disgust|True
I'm afraid of getting Delta, which is why I want to get vaccinated, but I'm also afraid of getting vaccinated at the vaccinated site, which is where I was infected.|fear|True
I thought that they wouldn't hold the Olympics until after the pandemic ended, so I was excited that the end was so close. |joy|True
"Watching the Olympics during the pandemic was like losing my last bit of hope, and it made me feel as if we had just given up of ever having a chance at going back to ""normal"", and a future of never ending COVID restrictions just seems hopeless.  "|sadness|True
I was delighted to see that the Olympics got moved to a date that I considered to be the end of the pandemic.|joy|True
I'm concerned that I might have COVID since the day after I met up with my girlfriend she tested positive for COVID.|fear|True
I was in (extremely) close contact with my girlfriend, who had COVID-19. I don't know what to do; I just got my 2nd dose that day, but now I'm exposed.|fear|True
I'm frustrated with my mother's hysteria and how it drives her to do something illogical and possibly harmful. |anger|True
I feel like what my mother is planning is wrong and could put others (children) at risk. |disgust|True
My mother lying to get a third shot and potentially taking away a vaccine from someone who genuinely needs one more than her is morally wrong to me.|disgust|True
My mother is closely (and perhaps, overzealously misinterpreting) these studies from Israel which has made her think that vaccine immunity is only 6 months long.|fear|True
I'm concerned about getting my girlfriend sick especially because I'm not sure that my (one dose) <ORG> vaccination is good enough. |fear|True
I'm confused on whether I should get a second vaccine because I'm considered fully vaccinated in France, but I also have an immunocompromised girlfriend, and I don't want to infect her.|fear|True
My child was exposed to COVID and even though he isn't showing symptoms now, because he can't get the vaccine and we live in a lower vaccinated area I'm afraid that it'll only be a matter of time before he gets COVID. |fear|True
I'm so upset that despite trying to do everything to keep my son safe he was still exposed to COVID, it makes me feel like I can't protect him. |sadness|True
It is very dangerous for my child to be in school right now because the pandemic is getting worse. My child just got exposed to COVID-19 and I am worried that he will get it too. I feel like COVID-19 will eventually get my child.|fear|True
My child was able to be cared for because my parents were able to help out.|joy|True
I feel defeated because all of our efforts to keep our child safe were thwarted.|sadness|True
The rise in vaccination rates makes me really excited. |joy|True
I'm happy that more people are getting vaccinated.|joy|True
I'm so upset with how no one seems to care about the possible long term symptoms and have given no attention to how to prevent them. |anger|True
I'm worried that my vaccine won't protect me, and I'm afraid of getting long term side effects from COVID that I will have to live with for the rest of my life. |fear|True
I feel disconnected from the people around me as they move on with their lives and enjoy things I used to enjoy, but I still don't know how to let go of my fear. |sadness|True
It frustrates me that there is a lack of attention going towards quality of life; just because one survives the virus doesn't mean their life is going to be the greatest. |anger|True

I am so happy to learn that vaccination rates are up, moving us closer to ending the pandemic.|joy|True
I'm afraid that research is showing the COVID vaccines aren't that effective at preventing infection since the current efficacy rates wouldn't have even met approval requirements last year.|fear|True
 I'm annoyed that the FDA did not inform the public that the <ORG> vaccine was not meeting efficacy expectations and instead just pushed through boosters to try to fix the issue.|anger|True
I am afraid that this will have a serious negative impact on our communities even though so many people received the vaccine and that there is still a high risk of transmission for many unsuspecting people.|fear|True
Thinking about how low the level of our immunity is likely to be makes me feel low and discouraged.|sadness|True
I'm afraid that we're never going to be able to put COVID past us, since the vaccines are only 50% effective against infection and booster shots can't keep up with the evolving new mutations and variants.|fear|True

I'm staring to think my life is over because COVID will always be here and all the things I'll never be able to do with my son because we can't go inside buildings. I would have no reason to live if I didn't have my husband and son.|sadness|True
Even though my PCR test was negative for COVID I'm still afraid that I got exposed to it, since I was around my family recently and they were exposed.|fear|True
I'm annoyed that most of the advice on these forums is geared toward Americans in the US, since COVID is affecting other parts of the world too and COVID cases are even worse elsewhere than they are in the US so it would be helpful for people to recognize that.|anger|True

I am angry that people can be so selfish as to only think about how Covid effects their country while many people around the world are still suffering.|anger|True
When hearing how so many places are getting back to normal life, many people are still suffering, which makes me sad and disheartened. |sadness|True

I am happy that I got the Covid vaccine, which prevented me from catching Covid from a confirmed exposure. |joy|True

I'm sad that a friend I had left our discussion group after 17 months of back-and-forth debating over our differing views on the vaccine, since they were so fed up that I didn't believe in their anti-vax views.|sadness|True
I'm sad that I lost a friend because of these types of debates over Covid vaccines and restrictions.|sadness|True

I feel sad knowing that I have made poor choices that will significantly impact so many people.|sadness|True

 I'm afraid that I may have had Covid again, but I'm just not really sure because the test results are conflicting.|fear|True
I'm feeling apprehensive about what the safest route to take is when masking up and going out for my personal life, since the Delta variant is so contagious and is overwhelming hospitals right now.|fear|True
I'm arguing with someone over what is riskier between a vaccinated, masked person in a store with average customers or two vaccinated people talking without masks.|anger|True
I'm feeling apprehensive because I've developed a lot of side effects from COVID including fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, stiffness and brain fog.|fear|True

I'm afraid that there could be a COVID variant that pops up that is even more resistant to vaccines than existing variants, though I don't think this fear will really play out as a reality.|fear|True

I felt terrorized to give the gifts back to my brother after 20 days in fear of contamination |fear|True

I know from experience how deadly the Covid virus is, and I have a huge fear of catching this and ending up dead.|fear|True
I'm terrified of the possibility that I could have caught COVID from a family member who's showing symptoms, since someone else in my family died a month ago from COVID.|fear|True
The way he acts so hypocritically and then makes all of these outrageous demands on me is totally ridiculous and controlling. I can't help but feel angry.|anger|True
 I am certain that he has Covid and am afraid of how many people he will spread it to because he is ignoring the reality of the situation.|fear|True

I'm have the opportunity to interview for a very good job but it's in person in a municipal building. Though I wonder about the COVID risk, I lose the opportunity to try.|fear|True

I want to go back to school but already at the start with orientation, everything is virtual. It's awful and I'm really disappointed. |disgust|True
I just can't deal with doing everything online and it makes me cry everyday. I want to see my friends without masks or distancing but I can't.|sadness|True
After returning to in-person therapy, I had to cancel my appointment because I had to take a covid test. I'm pretty sure it's negative and just my asthma but I don't want to take a chance on spreading it if it's positive.|anger|True

I'm sad because I've been really lonely throughout the pandemic and many clubs in college have been cancelled or disorganized so I have no social outlet.|sadness|True
I'm having a rough time right now due to loneliness and I'd love to meet someone to talk to and perhaps become friends. I'll be there for you and not judge.|sadness|True
I'm annoyed that my kids' school superintendent is going to wait to see if masks are needed before instituting a mandate, which doesn't make any sense since it's obviously safer to take preventative measures proactively.|anger|True
I'm afraid for the health of my kids since school is starting next week and schools aren't mandating masks and only encouraging them, which means that some students may not be masked.|fear|True
My kids start school next week but the school isn't requiring masks, only encouraging it. It's ridiculous, the superintendent says they reevaluate if things get bad but not until then.|anger|True

I feel overwhelmed by sadness that it has come to treating each other this way. |sadness|True
I'm annoyed that social media and the mainstream media have created such fear mongering over COVID since it's so unnecessary and has just caused everyone's anxiety and mental health to go haywire.|anger|True

I'm annoyed that I still need to be vigilant about COVID precautions when I'm already vaccinated.|anger|True

I'm tired and angry that we are still going through this after all the precautions, vaccines, and lockdowns. Reddit users who still claim Covid is serious no matter your vaccine status really annoy me because that means there is no point to the vaccine.|anger|True
I am afraid that we will continue to be told to get vaccines that do not help, do it, and then still be in a pandemic. |fear|True
I'm disgusted that Brazil's leader has been sabotaging vaccine purchases ever since they first came because Brazil has been hit the second hardest in the world in terms of COVID deaths and that didn't have any effect on him.|disgust|True
I disgusted to see man being like  this even with people dying around him|disgust|True
It was pleasure to see people getting vaccine even when they did not support it |joy|True

I am in fear of both covid and the test|fear|True
It was sad for me to hear about the test from my housemate |sadness|True

After being in hospital now I am scared of being exposed to the delta variant"|fear|True

My cousin lied and said they've had no symptoms for two weeks but that was a lie. I know her mother still has the virus and they are close.|anger|True
I went to an outdoor family wedding and it seemed to be going well with distancing and masks. Then two other cousins showed up with 13 kids that all just had COVID.|disgust|True
I told my kids not to play with the other kids who had had COVID when I saw them together and then we left because I was so upset by it.|fear|True
I'm angry that it seems like vaccines do nothing to prevent COVID cases or hospitalization rates, since a country that has very high vaccination rates that was a model for the vaccine's efficacy is now seeing COVID cases and hospitalizations skyrocket again.|anger|True
If vaccinating people doesn't work then fuck it!|anger|True
They were the country everyone watched because they showed us that vaccinating people worked.  And now I'm reading that it didn't work after all and the country is going backwards proving that nothing works.|fear|True
I'm happy that the number of hospitalizations due to COVID went down for the first time in two weeks since this is a good sign that we're getting control over the virus.|joy|True
I've had symptoms for two weeks and had a negative rapid test. The doctor ordered a PCR test and I wonder about it coming back positive after a negative rapid.|fear|True
I'm apprehensive about the accuracy of my negative rapid test because I've had two weeks of COVID-like symptoms.|fear|True

I'm disgusted that there are dentists out there who are refusing to get vaccinated since they're endangering their patients that they are in incredibly close proximity to.|disgust|True
While trying to find a dentist, I called several to see if they take COVID seriously and none of them do. Two said their dentists were not vaccinated. That's insane when they're a few inches from your face. |anger|True
I found this website and I want to take it seriously but they keep changing date estimation. I wonder if we should trust it?|fear|True
I'm afraid that I'm going to lose my sense of taste and smell from COVID since it could mean I won't be able to taste or smell my favorite foods again.|fear|True
I'm really sad that I might have my senses permanently altered by COVID since I can't imagine a life where I can't taste and smell my favorite foods.|sadness|True

I'm annoyed that my boss wants me to go into work in a few days if I test negative for COVID because it's not unreasonable of me to want to play it safe and not go into work where I've been exposed to COVID when I work in a healthcare office and live with immunocompromised, at-risk individuals.|anger|True
I'm afraid that I could potentially expose people to COVID and that worry could become a reality since I was exposed to my boss, who's tested positive for COVID.|fear|True
  It's annoying to me that he is acting like my concerns are unwarranted and that I am overreacting. I get no choice in how this turns out for me and those that I live with, which is really frustrating.|anger|True

My elderly mother is vaxxed and will need a booster. I've heard some people are sneaking through and getting boosters before the announcement which is not fair to people like my mother.|anger|True
I'm sad that COVID seems to be never ending because even if experts claim that Delta will peak in the South in September, it's definitely headed for the North in the winter.|sadness|True
We keep getting data that tries to predict the end of Delta but it's never right...now it's after the holidays. I can't take it much longer especially since it's just as bad with the vaccines.|anger|True
I'm sad that I've given up the best years of my life just to quarantine and go through cycles of COVID restrictions day in and day out.|sadness|True
I am sick to death of hearing and talking about the virus, sick of living the virus life, and the obsession people have for it. You can't get a way from it.|anger|True
I do the same thing day in and day out, and it never changes. I think life as we knew it is gone and I'll keep living this life until I die.|sadness|True
I feel so much more positive with the vaccines and the boosters being available. I'm a teacher and it makes me feel more confident to be around so many at school...this is definitely a good thing.|joy|True

Even though I am vaccinated I fear that I might get through my roommate who is not interested in vaccination  |fear|True
I was happy to have COVID because I only had light symptoms for 1-2 days and then got to party it up in a hotel for a quarantine period of 12 days which was awesome.|joy|True
I was scared that someone I know who was vaccinated and masked was in the hospital for a week because of the Delta variant, since that means her symptoms were really severe despite her vaccinated status.|fear|True
I'm sad I can't even have any semblance of hope anymore for things to improve since I haven't been able to see any of my friends since COVID started and the Delta variant has pushed back the plans I had made to start seeing them.|sadness|True
Due to the fear of covid I stopped speaking with most of the people around me|fear|True
I felt happy after getting counselling and it also enabled me talk and hang with my friends|joy|True

I fear the covid particles might be on my things after 40 people looked around my room|fear|True
I'm afraid that I could catch COVID from the open house that my landlord had for my house rental today, since 40 people came through to see my place within two hours and that could leave a lot of virus particles in the air.|fear|True

I am afraid of the consequences of receiving so many vaccines that we only have limited information about and don't know their long-term effects.|fear|True
I'm sad that I won't be able to see the girl that I have a crush on before she leaves for school if I actually quarantine for the full amount of time that I'm supposed to following my COVID diagnosis. |sadness|True

I'm annoyed at myself for having let my guard down uncharacteristically this weekend by attending a really densely crowded dance club with my friends, since the space was really crowded and a big risk for COVID.|anger|True
I'm disgusted with myself for having thought it was okay to go to an uncomfortably crowded dance club this weekend when that puts me and others at risk for catching COVID.|disgust|True
I'm afraid of potentially spreading COVID to anyone, especially my thesis advisor who has a young child at home, so I've been vigilant about cancelling and postponing my in-person meetings after going to a dance club.|fear|True
I feel disgusted of myself of being in a crowed area with out wearing a mask|disgust|True

I am sad, lonely and remembering how things used to be before Covid and am trying to be hopeful when thinking of how things will be when this is over.|sadness|True
I'm annoyed because someone I know is so paranoid about getting COVID that she's policing my behavior to the max and even locked me out of the car once for not wearing gloves when going out.|anger|True
I am really annoyed of my friend being over protective |anger|True

Even after getting vaccination I have to wear mask in college this make me furious|anger|True

I'm sad because it seems like the pandemic will never end, since the Delta variant has brought our society right back to where we originally started in terms of case counts.|sadness|True
My psychiatrist made me feel better about my fears and depression and I'm glad I talked to him. The FDA may approve vaccines for kids under 12 very soon and maybe we'll see life starting to get back to normal. I hope it's soon.|joy|True

I miss doing things and hate having to follow the guidelines. I want to go back to normal life. Will we ever stop having to live like this?|sadness|True

I'm fearful of the risks of COVID, but I feel like I have nowhere to turn to alleviate this fear since I'm also fearful of the side effects of the vaccine as well as the needle required to get the shot.|fear|True
I'm sad because no one understands the extreme anxieties that I have about my health and thus they don't understand why I haven't been able to get myself vaccinated yet.|sadness|True

I am worried that this could turn into a super spreader event and that my friend and other travelers will be at risk of catching COVID. |fear|True

I fear these mental health issues could have been caused by COVID, and if so, I don't know what the long term outcome will be. |fear|True
It's annoying to me that students are arguing for mandatory testing because they're irrationally acting like the pandemic has just started when it hasn't, and they're forgetting that the purpose of the vaccine is to keep us from getting sick rather than to keep us from getting infected.|anger|True
It's really disgusting that students are going to mandate testing for COVID because that's going to encourage them to blow COVID case counts out of proportion, just as society did when the pandemic started.|disgust|True

I fear that the additional COVID testing will lead to unintended consequences and we will be losing out on in-class learning again. |fear|True
I know someone who don't do anything to help themselves or anyone else when it comes to COVID protocols. Nothing...no mask, no vax, nothing. Yet, she whines about being a victim. It's infuriating.|anger|True

My friend's deadbeat attitude toward not wearing masks and not getting the vaccine angered me enough to decide to block her on Facebook.|anger|True

I'm feeling pretty annoyed that there isn't a consensus over whether boosters are really need or not.|anger|True

I'm feeling depressed and down because I'm unable to see a therapist in person, which would improve my mental health a lot since I'm having a hard time making friends or meeting people.|sadness|True

I'm feeling sad because COVID has been raging for so long now, thanks to the many people who won't get vaccinated.|sadness|True
By choice, people have remained unvaccinated and they are, sadly paying the price for it.|sadness|True

I avoid some of my coworkers as much as I can, but I do not want to offend them. Overall, I am not sure how to approach my coworkers about my concerns regarding covid. |fear|True
I'm concerned about whether research shows that breakthrough cases can lead to long-term loss of taste and smell, since I got a breakthrough case and have generally recovered except for the loss of those senses.|fear|True
From what I can gather, it looks like the the cases have peaked but they keep putting up mask mandates and it's annoying.|anger|True
I feel guilty because I ended up lying about having not gotten the vaccine before when I knew that I had gotten it.|sadness|True
I went to get my shot and while there, I suffered a panic attack about getting the vaccine. Not because I'm anti-vax but just frightened for no reason. I had to leave and make another appointment. It makes no sense to me.|fear|True
I was scared enough about the <ORG> vaccine that I suddenly had to walk out of my appointment.|fear|True

I am terrified that we won't get COVID under control and we will have to keep living in isolation, at risk of serious illness and death.|fear|True

I am sad that the COVID pandemic is still going on, hopefully the new vaccines will make a difference. |sadness|True
I am worried how my friends would react if I invite an unvaccinated person to stay at my home. I am not sure if I should invite this person and I do not want to worsen the situation by inviting two more unvaccinated people. |fear|True
I'm worried that other unvaccinated friends of my significant other are going to want to stay with us or hang out with us, and that as a result, I'm going to have to go into strict quarantine in order to prevent other people from getting sick.|fear|True

My SO's friend is visiting and she's not vaccinated so our other friends don't want to hang out with us because of her, which I understand. |anger|True
I will be putting myself into quarantine because I feel guilty about being around an unvaccinated person. I don't want to put my friends in harm's way because I may have been exposed. I would feel terrible if I didn't quarantine.|sadness|True
I'm annoyed that no one is going to want to get the booster even if it's necessary, since anti-vaxxers are going to complain about it and even people who got fully vaccinated are going to think they're protected enough to not need the booster.|anger|True
I'm concerned that we're going to need to convince people to get booster shots since it's going to be impossible to do so, especially since asking people to get the first shot has been extremely difficult.|fear|True
The anti-vaxxers are going to be up in arms over this booster program. They'll say it doesn't work and pat themselves on the back for not getting the vaccine. I'm not looking forward to it.|anger|True
If our vaccines begin to slowly lose their efficacy, then we are doomed to a lot more time fighting COVID than we first thought.|fear|True

I am happy that the vaccine not only helps stop the spread of COVID but also eases the symptoms if you do catch it.|joy|True
I'm getting conflicting information about what to do when you've being around people who've been near a positive person. Some say stay home and some say wearing a mask is the only thing necessary. Where can I find the real answer to this question? I'm really confused.|fear|True
I'm a bit apprehensive about whether I could have gotten COVID from having come in contact with people who have COVID, even though I'm vaccinated, so I want to know what the best practices for those in my shoes are.|fear|True
It's really annoying when your own mayor won't follow the guidelines for COVID. The mayor of London went clubbing without a mask and yet expects us to wear one all the time. Why are the politicians above the rules?|anger|True
I feel annoyed because our area has the strictest COVID restrictions, but our own mayor isn't following them because she's just going out to nightclubs without wearing a mask, and that's her own rule.|anger|True
It's disgusting how hypocritical our leaders are since they don't wear masks out but expect the public to do so and there seems to be no end in sight for the mask mandate.|disgust|True

I am keeping with all the guidelines for now including wearing a mask - inside and out, and social distancing. I'm also thinking about getting the <ORG> two shot vaccination and pretending I never got the other one|fear|True
I'm feeling apprehensive about getting the Chinese vaccine since there isn't really any data available to prove that it actually works, although it is the safer option since the <ORG> vaccine might lead to blood clots which could be dangerous.|fear|True
I'm have concerns about the two options I have for vaccines. Not enough information about the Chinese vaccine and too much negative information about the <ORG>. |fear|True
I've done everything that's been suggested to do to keep safe but it doesn't feel like enough. I'm so tired and so afraid.|fear|True
I'm feeling overwhelmed with this pandemic. Now we can't get the boosters if not at risk. I'm just at a loss.|sadness|True
I'm angry because I now realize the vaccine isn't that effective in preventing hospitalizations, and my celebrations for the <ORG> vaccine were all premature.|anger|True

I'm sad that I will need to quarantine again since I'm not able to get a booster, as I was determined to not be at risk for COVID.|sadness|True
I'm feeling apprehensive because it doesn't seem as thought the first doses are keeping pace at the level that they should be, as the numbers of first dosages are sort of just stagnating when they should be increasing.|fear|True
I'm sad because I really need to prioritize my mental health during the pandemic by finding a therapist and have not been able to find anyone, thanks to the high demand that has resulted from COVID.|sadness|True

I felt joy as thing getting better in south|joy|True

I'm feeling terrified that I will be forced to go back into the office and work even if I still have very severe symptoms from COVID that I haven't fully recovered from.|fear|True
I am annoyed by the careless behavior of my roommates. |anger|True
I was really angry because when I came home from work last night, my roommates both had their girlfriends over which broke their promise to limit guests to one a day in total. That's upsetting to me since this promise already represents a compromise on local COVID restrictions on gatherings.|anger|True
It's disgusting to me that my roommates don't follow our local restrictions which mandate that only household members meet with each other, since they always have guests over to visit.|disgust|True
I feel sad that my roommate gave me such a condescending look when I expressed my concerns about having many guests over during the pandemic.|sadness|True
This pandemic has made me feel down and hopeless. |sadness|True
Too many unvaccinated people are making it impossible for herd immunity and that's frightening. And the FDA says no to booster shots so how does that help us?|fear|True

I'm disgusted by the ignorance of anti-vaxxers since they have absolutely no clue how to interpret the facts that people are truly dying from COVID.|disgust|True
I'm so angry at the selfishness of some of our citizens who don't care about anyone else but themselves. They don't care about children, elderly...the vulnerable. It's frustrating that they just don't care and are proud to say so.|anger|True
I'm angry that some people are selfish enough to refuse to get vaccinated even when they know that their decision to not get vaccinated has a societal impact because it may cause other people to die.|anger|True
It's disgusting to me that people won't get the vaccine since they just don't want it, when it's factually proven that hospitals are overcrowded and people can get really sick from COVID.|disgust|True
After going bowling with friends one day, I got a mild cough and sore muscles the next day. I got tested immediately and was positive for COVID. I'm really concerned because one of my friends in immunocompromised.|fear|True
I'm worried that my friends could have contracted COVID from me, especially since one of my friends is immunocompromised and is thus at a higher risk for getting COVID and having serious symptoms.|fear|True
So many careless people that don't care at all and I'm the one who gets sick. I've been careful, I shouldn't be sick, just makes me so angry.|anger|True

I'm sad because COVID stressors have totally wreaked havoc on my mental health over the last year, since I'm tired of being stressed out when I see people around me not wearing masks.|sadness|True
As we are still in pandemic I fear that this will not end next year|fear|True
Its sad to see people refusing to vaccineate with new variant controlling us |sadness|True
We're never going to reach herd immunity because a lot of people are anti-vaccination. I'm scared this will never go away.|fear|True
This pandemic is really getting me down. I think I need to talk to a friend that I really admire or at least talk to my psychiatrist. I'm trying to stay positive but I just can't.|sadness|True
I feel joy in hosting a test show and this enable some people to relax and make them feel better|joy|True
I am having an extra hard time with the pandemic because I can't wear masks. I have a form of autism that triggers trauma and depression when I wear one more than a few minutes. It makes it extremely difficult to be around people.|fear|True
I want to go to a function with my friends but they insist I wear a mask all the time. I can't do that...I have medical issues that prevent it and I can't wear them for more than a few minutes.|sadness|True
It's annoying that my friends don't understand that my desire to not wear a mask is linked to my autism, because this shows a lack of empathy.|anger|True
As I had nothing to do Tv was the only thing but it also felt boredom at some point|disgust|True
After a horrendous two months in the hospital fighting COVID and problems after being intubated, I been trying to find some of the shows I watched in the hospital to re-watch them at home. They were mostly documentaries about COVID. It did help me cope while I was in there.|sadness|True
Due to the lower number of case I felt joyed|joy|True
I hope it was an error but, a couple of days ago, I was searching for our daily new cases of COVID and it was down by almost 50% from five days ago. Then yesterday, it was down to 50,000 cases a day from 80,000. Is it too much to hope that our pandemic is coming to an end?|joy|True
I am annoyed that people are not taking simple precautions when COVID is not under control. |anger|True
I am disgusted that I would be treated this way when I am only trying to protect my love ones from catching COVID. |disgust|True
I am afraid that COVID is only going to keep spreading and more people will die because no one seems to be taking any precautions anymore.|fear|True
I still follow basic COVID guidelines but people I know give me a hard time for wanting them to follow them also, especially in my home.|anger|True
Why isn't the whole country trying to set a good example by following the COVID guidelines, especially on TV and at other prominent functions.|disgust|True

I realized, when I had COVID, how much I enjoyed my life and how much I missed it. Now that I am well, I am so grateful for the chance to get back to my life.|joy|True
I'm apprehensive about whether I'm truly protected, since I got fully vaccinated over four months ago and I recently read that the <ORG> vaccine decreases in efficacy over time from 90% efficacy to 77%.|fear|True
Since I'm in a category that can't get the booster, I'm getting anxious because <ORG> is only 77% effective after four months. What are we supposed to do?|fear|True
It's really annoying that the media has been giving people so many mixed messages about whether to get vaccinated or not, since the media either indicates that vaccination doesn't work or that we'll all die without the vaccine.|anger|True
I'm disgusted that the media has distorted messaging around vaccination so much and made so many people confused about whether they really need the vaccine or not.|disgust|True
I'm a little worried because there isn't enough data about the effectiveness of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine against the delta variant, and I'm going on a trip soon and want to know whether I'll be sufficiently protected.|fear|True
I am disgusted with the media for their complete failure to educate the public on the vaccines.|disgust|True

I have people in my life that don't believe the virus is real and tell me to get over it. I can't get over it...I know it's real and it's infuriating.|anger|True
I love my father and don't want to lose him. His body couldn't handle getting the virus. I am so afraid something will happen to him.|fear|True
COVID hit our family hard and my father was put in hospice. He survived but is so frail and weak. He has difficulty eating and has 90% scarring on his lungs. It's so hard to see my dad this way.|sadness|True

I'm worried about the side effects that could come with a complete vaccination, since I currently only have the first shot of the <ORG> vaccine.|fear|True
I had part of my lung removed and so my lung capacity is not as strong as a person with normal lungs. So COVID could be harder on me than others. I'm wondering if I should get the <ORG> booster. Some reports say no so I'm not sure.|fear|True
I'm feeling apprehensive about getting the third <ORG> shot since scientists aren't generally approving members of the public to get that shot.|fear|True
It's annoying that society is being so resistant to getting back to a way of life that could be considered normal based on our pre-COVID days.|anger|True
It's disgusting that people are refusing to be vaccinated since that is what is keeping our society from going back to our pre-COVID normalcy.|disgust|True
The society here is not taking Covid-19 seriously. I am angry the people are careless and do not follow the preventative measures even when the pandemic worsens. |anger|True

I'm fearful because COVID is now presenting really serious risks again and I can no longer go to my appointments without worrying about catching COVID.|fear|True

It's annoying that my dad wants to stop me from being able to socialize in a very safe manner with others, just because we won't be wearing masks while eating indoors.|anger|True
It's sad to me that the only way that my dad will allow me to attend my club's dinner and board game night is if I don't eat and if I stay far away from others, since there's no point in attending if that's the case.|sadness|True
I can't even get accurate information on how accurate the tests are. It's so annoying.|anger|True

I wanted to live my life to help my mental health, but now this article has come out that has confirmed my biggest fear.|fear|True
